Autonomous robots and vehicles are expected to become an integral part of our environment soon. Unsatisfactory issues (esp. for path planning) regarding interaction
with existing road users, performance in mixed-traffic areas, and lack of interpretable behavior remain key obstacles. To address these, we present a physics-based 
neural network, based on a hybrid approach combining a social force model extended by group force (SFMG) with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict pedestrian 
trajectories considering its interaction with static obstacles, other pedestrians, and pedestrian groups. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the model 
concerning realistic prediction, prediction performance, and prediction "interpretability". Initial results suggest that, even when solely trained on a synthetic 
dataset, the model can predict realistic and interpretable trajectories with better than state-of-the-art accuracy.
